A.

1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?

i) Theater has the highest crowdfunding events (344) followed by Film & Video (178) and Music (174). Observing the subcategories, 344 out of total crowdfunding (1000) was done for the category ‘play’.

ii) The data shows that 57% of the total crowdfunding was successful while the failure rate was 36%. However, 4% of total crowdfunding was canceled. 

iii) Monthly trend of the crowdfunding shows maximum success rate during July followed by sudden decline in August.

2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?
i) The dataset does not provide a complete story. There can be several other factors like social and economic aspects that could be included in the analysis as those conditions vary among one country to another and are main driving criteria in the success or failure of a crowdfunding. 

ii) It is difficult to make a conclusion about the monthly trend as there is not a significant peak in success or failure over the months. Trend is more or less uniform.
	
3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
Frequency distribution plot could help in interpretation. Data has very high variance and likely skewed, handling the raw data seems to be challenging. Data transformation and smoothening will help in statistical analysis.

B.	Statistical Analysis


		
1.	Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.
The data has very high variance as well as std. deviation which means that data is skewed, spread far from the average or mean and possibility of outliers. Under such circumstances, median will better summarize the data. 

2.	Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
	Variability in successful campaigns is ten times higher than unsuccessful campaigns which make sense as the crowdfunding events depends on several factor like the advertisement, its possible impacts and outcomes, relevant to its goal, people participation, social media impact etc. all these factor can have its role in wide spread of donations and high variability in success rate.
